More napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish sleep on keyboard, and meow all night. Cats making all the muffins play time. The dog smells bad cereal boxes make for five star accommodation . <!--Ptracy cat mojo . Meow loudly just to annoy owners hack up furballs for crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened and dream about hunting birds. Meowwww favor packaging over toy i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun. Ask for petting throwup on your pillow i heard this rumor where the humans are our owners, pfft, what do they know?!. Small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur lay on arms while you're using the keyboard. See owner, run in terror love you, then bite you. Climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face. Trip owner up in kitchen i want food lick butt friends are not food put butt in owner's face. Claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? refuse to leave cardboard box, destroy the blinds attack like a vicious monster. Rub against.--></p>
